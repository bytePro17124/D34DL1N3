#D34DLINE Task Priority

_A prioritization program for the unorganized_

## Goal
Build a user-friendly UI and system in a lightweight program that will allow a user to:

1. Enter in tasks, homework, anything and a Deadline Date.
	* Based on this Data, the program will display the most urgent task along with some tips
	* and queue up any additional added tasked based on their deadline. Until the list is clear,
	* it will prompt you to complete taskes based on which is most urgent. Optionally the program
	* will generate reports by the week, month, year or specific date range. These will include
	* conclusive data long with tips based on how things are percieved.


## ToDO
